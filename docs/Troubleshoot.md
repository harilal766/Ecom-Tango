## Troubleshooting

- **API Errors**: Ensure your API credentials are correct and have the necessary permissions. Check the platformâ€™s developer portal for error details.
- **Database Issues**: Verify your database is running and credentials in `settings.py` are correct. Run `python manage.py check` to diagnose issues.
- **Dependency Conflicts**: If `pip install` fails, ensure your Python version is compatible (3.8+). Try upgrading pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`.
- **Server Not Starting**: Check for errors in the terminal. Ensure no other process is using port 8000.
